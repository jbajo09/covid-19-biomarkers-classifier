# COVID-19 biomarkers recogntion & classification
In this repository you can find code used to implement the pipeline proposed in 'COVID-19 biomarkers recogntion & classification using intelligence systems'.
This code allow to integrate several RNA-Seq cohort in one expression matrix, to develop supervised classification models and to apply feature selection algorithms.

Gene expression data needed to run the code is available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1zt8louDU4iy0aKjt3o_ezAYnev3TZqe6 

Shiny app code is available at shiny.R script. To run the app you should download shiny folder available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U5de2BujV-JOcj93wPmkBo5mKzo7Noes/view?usp=sharing.
